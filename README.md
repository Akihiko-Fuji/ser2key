# ser2key

# Abstract:
This program, titled "Serial to Keyboard" (ser2key), is a Python-based utility that allows serial data received from a specified serial port to be automatically typed as keyboard input on the system. The software continuously listens for incoming data via the configured serial port and, upon receiving valid data, simulates keyboard events by pasting the data from the clipboard and optionally sending an "Enter" keypress. The program is designed with a simple graphical user interface (GUI) using a system tray icon for easy interaction. It handles serial port configuration via an external config.ini file, ensuring flexibility in serial communication settings (e.g., baud rate, parity, timeout). The software also provides error handling and uses multithreading to allow continuous serial data reading while maintaining responsive task tray functionality.

# Key features include:
Configurable serial communication settings.
Ability to paste received data as keystrokes via the clipboard.
Optional "Enter" keypress after each input.
System tray icon for easy monitoring and program control.
Error handling with notifications for missing configuration or serial connection issues.
The program utilizes libraries like pyautogui for keyboard simulation, pyperclip for clipboard management, serial for serial communication, and pystray for the system tray icon functionality.

# Program Development Targets:
The key feature of barcode readers, especially when reading QR codes, is their ability to convert at ultra high speed.
One of the most useful features is that the output speed when retrieving strings containing Japanese characters, Japanese half-width kana character, Chinese characters, Korean characters from QR codes is significantly faster than that of other tools.
The specific performance comparison target is Keyence's AutoID Keyboard Wedge　https://www.keyence.co.jp/support/codereader/blsrus/soft/#d12　, which operates about 10 times faster in conversion than the AutoID Keyboard Wedge.

# Operating environment:
The program has been tested on Windows. Because the program is resident in the task tray, etc., the program needs to be modified when used on other operating systems.
Any device that uses a serial port can be used, whether it is a hardware RS-232C port, via USB, or Bluetooth SPP.
